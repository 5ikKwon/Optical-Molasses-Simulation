# Optical-Molasses-Simulation
This is my first repository for simulating Optical Molasses. 

Two level atom based optical molasses simulation will be first implemented. 

The final goal of this project is simulating QT3 lab's Ru 2D+ and 3D MOT.

I might use this project as to get farmiliar myself to the file management tool. 
So many meaningless activities might be seen from this project.

Excited to start this project and learn many thigs!
